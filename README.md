# Big Update 
The motivation for this application was to reduce the annoyance factor in regard to sending daily status update emails to project managers.  You can quickly enter various tasks and details that you worked on throughout the day. 

<b>This application is focused around sending Outlook emails, since It's the email platform that the company I work for uses.</b>
