# Big Update 
The motivation for this application was to reduce the annoyance factor in regard to sending daily status update emails to project managers.  This application allows you to quickly enter various tasks and details that you worked on throughout the day.  Included with this project is a sqlite database that allows you to store contacts and quickly call every time you wish to send an email.  This application is focused around sending Outlook emails, since It's the email platform that the company I work for uses.
